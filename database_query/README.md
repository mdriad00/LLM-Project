This is an end to end LLM project based on Google Palm and Langchain. I build a system that can talk to MySQL database. User asks questions in a natural language and the system generates answers by converting those questions to an SQL query and then executing that query on MySQL database. 

AtliQ Tees is a T-shirt store where they maintain their inventory, sales and discounts data in MySQL database. A store manager will may ask questions such as,

- how many total tshirt have in my database?
- If we have to sell all the levi's tshirt today with discount applied, how much revenue our store will generate?
